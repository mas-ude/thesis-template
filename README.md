# thesis-template

This LaTeX/LuaLaTeX template is meant for papers written at "Modellierung adaptiver Systeme" (MAS). It can be personalized with options for different types of papers (e.g. bachelor thesis, master thesis, dissertations).

The options are explained in the example .tex files.

## Required software

- TeX Live 2015 or equivalent
- TeX Live packages:
	- Windows:
		- `collection-luatex` for LuaLaTeX support
	- Linux:
		- `texlive-genericextra`
		- `texlive-bibtexextra`
		- `biber` (some distributions ship it in `texlive-bibtexextra` or `texlive-bin`)

## Troubleshooting

- If you change the language, remember to delete all files that were generated by LaTeX/LuaTeX or there will be errors with `babel`
